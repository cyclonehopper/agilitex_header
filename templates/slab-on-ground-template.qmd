# Introduction {#sec-intro} 


Dyno Nobel engaged BGER Qld to conduct an analytical check of the existing slab to be used as a maintenance floor.  The slab is to support a series of Portalift to lift an MPU with a gross weight of 23Tonnes. As advised by the client, 6 portalift will be used, with a maximum load of 4Tonnes.

The same slab is also supporting the columns that supports a mezzanine floor to be used as a workshop floor.  The mezzanine floor was also checked, refer 24177-ST-CAL-0001 for the column reactions to be used in checking the slab.

This calculation presents the results of the analytical check of the slab.  For the analytical check of the mezzanine floor and columns, refer 24177-ST-CAL-0001.

## Exclusions


  - Calculation of loads transmitted to the base of the Portalift.  It was provided by the client.
  - Geotechnical analysis of the subgrade


## Basis of Design


In general, concrete design is in accordance with AS 3600.  For unreinforced industrial floors, design is carried in accordance with CCAA T48-2009.

# Methodology


SLab design is carried out by manual calculation using T48 and FEA. The use of FEA in calculating the design action is required as the manual method cannot account for the irregularity of load positions. 

The slab (plain concrete, UNO) capacity will be calculated in accordance with CCAA T48-2009. For reinforced concrete option, capacity will be calculated in accordance with AS 3600.

# Design of Portalift Slab

## Soil subgrade conditions (assumed)

![Approximate correlations of soil bearing and CBR](https://i.imgur.com/zcnZSZZ.png){#fig-cbr}

soil parameters will be assume to have a CBR of 10. The allowable bearing and modulus of subgrade reaction, Ks, are estimated from @fig-cbr and shown below.

```{julia}
Hsoil = 3m  # soil thickness
CBR = 10
q_all = 130kPa
Ks = 200psi / inch |> kPa / mm |> f2  # modulus of subgrade reaction for FEA model of subsoil.
```

![Figure 1.24 Correlation between long term Young's modulus and CBR](https://i.imgur.com/vlHfMua.png){#fig-1.24 width="350"}

From @fig-1.24, the long term Young's modulus is given below.
```{julia}
νc = 0.33
Esl = fEsl(CBR) |> f2
```

From @fig-beta, for predominantly sandy soil, short term Young's modulus given below.

```{julia}
β = 0.8
Ess = Esl / β |> f2
```

## Post load

load repititions, assume design life 25yrs, 4 lift cycle a day
```{julia}
ncycles = 25 * 365 * 4
```

23t Vehicle, 6 Portalift, 4 Tonnes per portalift.

## Scenario 1 - 6 Equal loads, isolated Hoist

![Portalift loads](images/portalift-loads.png){#fig-wheel_load} 

calculate wheel load, distribution per @fig-wheel_load 

```{julia}
Phoist = 23Tonnef / 4 |> kN |> f2
γload_wheel = upreferred(33.1kN / 7500kgf)
Ppost = Phoist * (1 - 2 * γload_wheel) / 2
# 2*Ppost + 2*Pwheel
```

The portion of loads that goes to the hoist column can be ignored, and all hoisted load goess to the two steel wheels.
 
Wheel spacing
```{julia}
s_wheel = 1070mm
```


Determine slab thickness

![Axle loads - interior
loading](https://i.imgur.com/dXKi9cP.png){width="400"}

```{julia}
#| echo: false
tslab, notes = fdesign_slab_interior(Paxle=Phoist, k1=k1, k2=k2, fc=fc, Ess=Ess, tread=s_wheel, Hsoil=Hsoil, isWheelLoad=false)
tslab_interior = roundto(tslab, 50mm)
println(notes)
```


## Scenario 2 - tandem axle - 2 Portalifts close to each other

Design verification by FEA. The slab in the model is 200mm thick.

![](images/rfem-tensile-stresses.png){#fig-tensile-stresses}

From @fig-tensile-stresses, the maximum principal tensile stress is 1.76MPa, less than the limit of `{julia} f_all`

# Design of slab for vehicle access

for vehicle maintenance, assume 1 vehicle per day passing through a certain point in slab.  Load on slab will be
```{julia}
n_axles = 3
ncycles_axle_load = n_axles * 1 * 365 * 25
```

```{julia}
k1_axle = 0.9
k2_axle = fk2(ncycles_axle_load)
```

## For interior slab
```{julia}
#| echo: false
tslab_vehicle_access, notes = fdesign_slab_interior(Paxle=8Tonnef, k1=k1_axle, k2=k2_axle, fc=fc, Ess=Ess, tread=1200mm, Hsoil=Hsoil, isWheelLoad=true)
# tslab_interior_vehicle_access = roundto(tslab_vehicle_access, 50mm)
println(notes)
```

The thickness requirements for vehicle access is less than that of the portalift.


## For edge thickening - 300 thick, 300 wide (interior thickness being 200)

need to calculate the wheel loads, assume 295/80R22.5 tires

```{julia}
p_tire = 100psi
b_tire = 295mm * 2 # dual tire
Paxle = 8Tonnef
l_load = Paxle / 2 / (p_tire * b_tire) |> mm |> f2
b_tire, l_load, p_tire |> kPa |> f2
```

![Design bending moment](images/rfem-vehicle-access-edge-moment-fatigue.png){#fig-design-moment-edge-vehicle-access-fatigue}

```{julia}
b = 300mm
db = 12mm # nominal bottom bar 2-N12
D = 300mm
cover = 50mm
d = D - cover - 0.5 * db
Abt = π / 4 * (9.7mm)^2 # top reo, SL002
Abb = π / 4 * db^2 # bottom reo

slab = AS3600RectSection(; fc=fc, fy=500MPa, b=b, d=d, D=D, nbt=2, nbb=2, Abt=Abt, Abb=Abb);
struct_to_dict(slab)
```

```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
slab.concrete_section.plot_section(filename="images/slab-section-plot.png");
```

![Concrete section](images/slab-section-plot.png){width="280"}


Refer @fig-design-moment-edge-vehicle-access-fatigue for fatigue design moment

```{julia}
res = fdesign_fatigue(; sec=slab,
    Mufat=1.1 * 28kN * m / m * 0.3m, # from FEA model
    nsc=ncycles_axle_load,
    steel_category="A");
res[1] |> println
```


Checking for top reo

![Design bending moment - top rebar](images/rfem-vehicle-access-edge-moment-top.png){#fig-design-moment-top-edge-vehicle-access}

```{julia}
res = fdesign_fatigue(; sec=slab, θ=180°,
    Mufat=1.1 * 19.4kN * m / m * 0.3m, # from FEA model
    nsc=ncycles_axle_load,
    steel_category="A");
res[1] |> println
```

checking interior slab next to the edge thickening to ensure flexural stresses not exceeded.

![Flexural tensile stresses - interior slab next to edge](images/rfem-tensile-stresses-interior-slab-edge-loading.png){#fig-tensile-stresses-edge-loading}

From @fig-tensile-stresses-edge-loading, the maximum stress is 1.0MPa < `{julia} f_all` allowable limit.


# Design of lab Supporting Mezzanine Column

## Column Load

Refer 24177-ST-CAL-0001 for details of load calculations.  

![SG model reaction - Working load](images/sg-column-working-load.png){#fig-working-load}

From @fig-working-load, the combined reaction of the post is 

```{julia}
P_post = 35 * 2kN;
s_post = 3.76m
```

## Minimum interior slab thickness

![Post Loads - Interior.Edge loading](images/chart1.3.png)

```{julia}
#| echo: false
tslab, notes = fdesign_tslab_post(P_post, fc, k1, Esl, s_post, Hsoil, isInterior=true, k2=1)
# tslab_interior = roundto(tslab, 50mm)
println(notes)
```


## Minimum edge slab thickness

```{julia}
#| echo: false
tslab_edge, notes = fdesign_tslab_post(P_post, fc, k1, Esl, s_post, Hsoil, isInterior=false, k2=1)
# tslab_interior = roundto(tslab, 50mm)
println(notes)
```


## Width of edge thickening{#sec-width-edge} 

The width of edge thickening is taken as the radius of relative stiffness as discuseed in TR34.

```{julia}
#| echo: false
b_edge_thickening = fLr(fc=fc, tslab=tslab_edge, νc=νc, Ks=Ks) |> mm |> f2
println("Minimum width of edge thickening = $b_edge_thickening")
```


Using FEA, the minimum required shall be 340mm thick and width of 1100, plain concrete design.

![Flexural tensile stress ratio](images/RFEM-edge-model-stress-ratio.png)


## Reinforced edge thickening

Considering typical edge thickening of 300 wide, 300 thick, with nominal N12 reinforcement

```{julia}
b = 300mm
D = 300mm
n = 2
db = 12mm
d = D - 50mm - db

slab = AS3600SinglyReinforcedBeam(; fc=32MPa, fy=500MPa, b, d, D, n, db, isFooting=true)

ϕMn, notes = fbeam_design_singly_reinf(; beam=slab, isIgnoreMinAst=false)
println(notes)
```

![Design bending moment](images/rfem-edge-reinforce-design-action.png){#fig-design-moment}

From @fig-design-moment, the maximum moment Mu = 72kN/m * 0.3m = 22kN*m < `{julia} ϕMn |> f2 `, OK.

## Critical bearing pressure, edge thickening

![Bearing pressure at edge, reinforced design](images/rfem-edge-reinforce-design-bearing.png){#fig-bearing}

From @fig-bearing, the maximum is 65kPa, less than allowable of `{julia} q_all |> f2`

{{< pagebreak >}}

# Summary and Conclusion

Based on the foregoing, the following concept design is deemed to satisfy the design requirements

  - Portalift Slab, interior
    - The minimum slab design thickness shall be 200mm, provided the underlying assumptions regarding the soil subgrade and concrete grade is confirmed.
    - With nominal shrinkage reinforcement of SL102.

  - Vehicle access slab
    - The minimum interior thickness is less than that for portalift. Use portalift design.
    - The minimum edge thickness shall be 300mm, 300mm wide, with SL102 top reinforcement, 2-N12 bottom reinforcement or equivalent.

  - Mezzanine Column Slab, reinforced concrete design per AS3600
    - The minimum interior slab thickness shall be 160 mm, with nominal shrinakge reinforcement of SL92.
    - The minimum edge thickening shall be 300 mm thick, 300 wide, with nominal 2-N12 bottom reinforcement, and SL92 top reinforcement, or equivalent.

# Recommendations

- Conduct x-ray testing of interior and edges of slab to determine thickness and  the reinforcement.
- Conduct core testing of concrete slab to determine compressive strength.
