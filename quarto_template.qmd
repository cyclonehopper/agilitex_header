# Introduction {#sec-intro}

## Calculation Objective / Scope

The existing boiler is to be removed by lifting it and inserting a skate
so it can be rolled out.

This calculation presents the FEA of the jacking plates added to the
boiler frame, and design of piping supports

## Exclusions

This calculation excludes the following: - design of rollers and
supporting mechanisms

## Basis of Design

In general, design is in accordance with AS 4100 for steel.

## Design Standards and Codes

Unless specifically noted, the design complies with Australian Standards
and selected international standards as listed in the Design Criteria.
The following summarizes the key standards used in producing this
calculation:

-   AS 1170.0 - 2002 Structural design actions - Part 0: General
    principles
-   AS 1170.1 - 2002 Structural design actions - Part 1: Permanent,
    imposed and other actions

# Methodology

-   Perform member check using Space Gass model, to get sanity check of the member capacity, design load ratio must be less than 1.0
-   Perform FEA of the jacking point and check for limiting stresses and strains, where applicable. Acceptance criteria as follows
    - design stress < 0.9Fy, for regions away from geometric discontinuities.
    - plastic equivalent strain (VM strains) < 5%

## Load - Jacking load

Load is applied as a differential displacement. The maximum differential is limited to L/600 = 7mm

## Load Combination: 1.35G + 7mm Differential
